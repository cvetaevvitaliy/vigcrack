# Vigcrack

*An old trinket from 2005/2003.*

``Vigcrack`` is a cryptoanalysis tool which can help on crack ``Vigenère`` ciphertexts. This tool is not strictly based on
``Babbage's``/``Kasiski's`` approach. In fact, here is not performed frequency analysis. Here what we get is a more brainy
``Hangman`` which does not hang any innocent stick figure ;)
